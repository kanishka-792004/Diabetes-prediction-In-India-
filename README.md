**#Diabetes-mellitus-prediction-In-India**

**📌 Project Title:**
Diabetes Mellitus Prediction in India

**🧠 Objective:**
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a person is likely to have Diabetes Mellitus based on key medical and demographic features.

**🔍 Problem Statement:**
Diabetes is a growing health concern in India. Early detection is crucial to prevent long-term complications. This project uses real-world data and machine learning algorithms to assist in early and reliable prediction of diabetes.

**🧰 Tools & Technologies Used:**
Google Colab (Notebook environment)

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ML Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes algorithm

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, TRaining time , mean prediction time 

**📊 Dataset Overview:**
Contains features like:
gender                 
age                   
hypertension           
heart_disease          
smoking_history        
bmi                    
HbA1c_level            
blood_glucose_level    
diabetes 

**🧪 Steps Performed:**

**Data Preprocessing:**

Handled missing/zero values in features

Normalized continuous variables

Split data into training and testing sets

**Model Building:**

Trained Logistic Regression and Naive bayes algorithm 

Compared performance using accuracy scores

**Model Evaluation:**

Generated confusion matrix and classification report

Selected best-performing model

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Plotted heatmaps, histograms, pair plots, box polt , bar chart

Identified key correlations between features and diabetes

**🧠 Key Learnings:**

Data cleaning is crucial for medical data

Logistic Regression often works well for binary classification problems

Visualization helps in feature selection and understanding data trends
